            <p>Diljit Dosanjh made his second appearance at the 2023 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Sunday. A few days ago, Diljit made history as the first Punjabi artist to perform at the music festival in Indio, California. The singer posted pictures and videos of his second performance on Instagram and garnered compliments from his followers, including Priyanka Chopra, Neha Dhupia, Richa Chadha, Raja Kumari, and more celebrities. For his second appearance, the global artist captured the essence of his cultural roots by channelling the quintessential Punjabi Munda in an all-white look. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0QGw1LZpxM&pp=ygUoZGlsaml0IGRvc2FuamggY29hY2hlbGxhIGRheSAxIGZ1bGwgbGl2ZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank">Catch the Glimpse of our own Dosanjhan Wala!</a></p>
